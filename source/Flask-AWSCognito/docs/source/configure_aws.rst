CloudFormation
--------------

The following  CloudFormation template will create

- User Pool, a directory of users

- User Pool Client - an entity that holds the configuration of authentication flow

Domain
------

The template doesn't create a Domain (not supported by CLoudFormation as of December 2019)
so it should be created manually from console or through API calls.

Both options - "Amazon Cognito domain" and "Your own domain" are supported. Don't forget to pass it
to Flask app config.


Redirect URL
------------

One of the stack parameters of the CloudFormation template is a redirect URL. It's a Flask endpoint users
will be redirected to after successful sign in (see **Usage**).


ID to pass to Flask
--------------------

After resources are created we need User Pool ID, User Pool Client ID and User Pool Client Secret
(not shown on the screenshots) to configure Flask:
